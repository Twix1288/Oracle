## ðŸ“Š **Database Schema**

### **oracle_feedback**
Stores detailed feedback for every Oracle interaction:
```sql
- satisfaction_score (1-5)
- helpful (boolean)
- response_quality (excellent/good/average/poor)
- accuracy (very_accurate/accurate/somewhat_accurate/inaccurate)
- relevance (very_relevant/relevant/somewhat_relevant/irrelevant)
- feedback_text (user comments)
- improvement_suggestions (AI-generated)
```

### **oracle_learning_insights**
Tracks learning progress and patterns:
```sql
- insights_data (JSONB with analysis results)
- pattern_analysis (satisfaction trends, query types)
- improvement_areas (identified weaknesses)
- success_factors (what works well)
- model_performance (AI model comparison)
```

### **oracle_user_learning_profiles**
Personalized learning profiles for each user:
```sql
- learning_preferences (response style preferences)
- successful_interaction_patterns (what works for this user)
- improvement_areas (personalized suggestions)
- satisfaction_trends (user's satisfaction over time)
```

## ðŸ”„ **How It Works**

### **1. User Interaction**
1. User asks Oracle a question
2. Oracle generates response using best available model
3. Response includes feedback collection system
4. Interaction is logged with full context

### **2. Feedback Collection**
1. User provides satisfaction rating and detailed feedback
2. Feedback is stored in `oracle_feedback` table
3. Learning loop is automatically triggered
4. User learning profile is updated

### **3. Learning Analysis**
1. AI analyzes recent feedback patterns
2. Identifies improvement areas and success factors
3. Updates model preferences based on performance
4. Generates insights for platform optimization

### **4. Continuous Improvement**
1. Oracle adapts responses based on learned patterns
2. Collaboration matching improves with success data
3. Platform becomes more personalized over time
4. Success rates increase through learning
